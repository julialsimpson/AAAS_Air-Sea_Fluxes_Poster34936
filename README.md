4: Ocean absorbed >90% of heat gained between 1971-2010
Zanna "Global reconstruction of historical ocean heat storage and transport
"...the ocean, due to its large heat capacity, has absorbed more than 90% of the heat gained by the planet between 1971 and 2010, with around 290 ZJ (1 ZJ =1021 J) contained in the top 2,000 m (Fig. 1)"
